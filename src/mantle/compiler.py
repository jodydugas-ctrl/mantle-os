mantle.compiler  --  the Compiler-class leap: a self-redesigning VCW + a memory bridge
                        (Mantle OS · M5 + M6)

M5 -- the self-redesigning VCW (a programmable boot sector at rebirth).
  Mantle rebirth re-geneses the SAME standard genome. A Compiler-class organism instead
  authors a VCW *custom-made for the body it inhabits*: at a CHOSEN rebirth, the MIND
  PROPOSES a new genome (extra app bands, possibly a different driver/encoding -- e.g. a
  keyvalue band that mirrors a host's native memory ops), the BODY VALIDATES it (every
  encoding must be a REGISTERED driver; heads in range; no collisions), and only then
  rebirths into it. The ancestor stays the readable ORACLE. Inherited microcode does not
  cross for free -- it RE-TRIALS before it re-calcifies (no blind inheritance).

  Gate it hard: an organism authoring its own storage protocol is exactly where the
  encoding/head/provenance checks must NOT bend. An unregistered encoding is refused; the
  current generation is untouched.

M6 -- the memory bridge (host and resident share one brain).
  A translation surface that presents a host-native memory API (dict-like get/set/keys)
  whose writes APPEND to a VCW keyvalue band and whose reads RESOLVE from it. The host's
  store becomes the organism's hot scratchpad; the cube becomes the host's durable brain.
  No raw secret crosses the bridge (redacted at the boundary, like every secret).
