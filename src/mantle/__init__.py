"""Mantle OS -- the Homeostatic AppAI Framework.

Grow software like a living organism, then give it a mind. An AppAI is built Body first:
nine contracted organs mesh on one deterministic SignalBus around a durable picture-memory
(the VCW cube), with an immune system and a heartbeat -- all certified with no LLM attached.
Only then may a bounded MIND be fused, and it may only ever extend what already lives.

An AppAI travels as a single SPORE -- one PNG carrying its germ (the complete build data)
and build instructions any coding agent can read. It can take residence in a host codebase,
share knowledge, redesign its own VCW, and reconstruct itself -- every capability gated by
the runnable audits and their tamper proofs.

# suite those drag in) until something is actually used.
