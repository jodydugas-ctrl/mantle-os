mantle.organs.reproduction  --  the Reproduction organ: how this creature makes another
                                (Mantle OS · the ninth organ, Grimoire 2.0 binding)

The framework grew many propagation verbs -- spore, egg, vault, anchor, symbiosis,
graft -- and `mantle.reproduction` showed they are two methods (SEED and GRAFT) wearing
different clothes. This organ gives those ceremonies a BODY-RESIDENT owner with a real
contract and a real runtime duty, instead of a loose routing module:

  * the two verbs      -- organism.reproduction.seed(...) / .graft(...) route to the
                          same canonical modules as ever (composition, not re-invention);
  * the vault tissue   -- the organism's own sealed seed lives in this organ's band;
                          every hatchery birth auto-vaults its egg (RESURGERE is a
                          birthright, not an option);
  * lineage continuity -- the runtime duty: on every rebirth the sealed seed (and the
                          sealed origin spore, if any) is CARRIED into the new Prime, or
                          its loss becomes an immune event. A body never silently sheds
                          the material it would need to rise again;
  * the band atlas     -- this organ is the keeper of vcw.bands.APP_BAND_ATLAS, the one
                          statement of every framework-reserved app-band range;
  * SPORE-DISTILLATION -- a spore PNG may become the PRIMER and the memories of the body
                          it births, and the spore itself is then sealed under the new
                          body's genesis key as SELF tissue in the `spore_vault` band.
                          THE KEY LAW: key material is MINTED at birth (secrets.token_hex),
                          NEVER derived from the spore -- spores travel publicly, and a
                          key derivable from public bytes would let any holder forge SELF
                          (SELF-1/SELF-3, anti-clone).

The spell-shape law holds here as everywhere: clone -> dissect -> capsule -> audit ->
optional zombie body. A SEED hatch is a BIRTH and faces the Stage-1 gate; an assimilation
(clone/applet) path stays a capsule until the gate itself says otherwise. Nothing in this
organ makes anything "alive" in one gulp.
