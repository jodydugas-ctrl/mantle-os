"""mantle.organs -- the eight canonical organs (Mantle OS).

Heart, Genome, Nervous System, Senses, Immune System, Limbs, Memory, Brain. Every organ
carries an OrganContract (manifest, reflex surface, band permissions, audit obligations,
fail mode) and communicates only via the SignalBus and the cube -- never by reaching into
another organ. Nothing in this package imports mantle.mind: Phase-1 code cannot reach an
LLM even by accident.
