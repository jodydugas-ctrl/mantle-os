mantle.organs.heart  --  the Heart organ: clock, heartbeat, circulation (Mantle OS)

The Heart is the only organ whose Phase-1 state is unconditionally ACTIVE: the Body has a
heartbeat with NO brain. Each pulse is a complete moment of awareness, in a fixed,
deterministic order (the organism's native tempo):

    1. tick                 advance the clock; emit `pulse` on the bus
    2. sense intake         Senses drains its inbox (all inbound enters here)
    3. context assembly     the Nervous System materializes the whole-at-once snapshot
    4. reflex execution     bus subscribers fire (registration order, fail-open)
    5. immune scan          the Immune System verifies the cube (every scan_every beats)
    6. checkpoint           circulate: flush dirty state durably (staged atomic commit)

Phase 2 extension: every natural pulse offers the assembled snapshot to the fused Brain
(cognition) -- an extension of the reflex, never a replacement. The natural cadence is
ten minutes (600 seconds). In Phase 1 the Brain slot is empty and the identical loop runs
whole. Nothing here imports a model.

NOCICEPTION (M1): pain, SIGNIFICANT input, distress, and scheduled work add stressor-
anchored wakeups; they never suppress or replace the unconditional natural baseline.
The snapshot is pre-anchored to {reason, band, ref} when a stressor exists.
