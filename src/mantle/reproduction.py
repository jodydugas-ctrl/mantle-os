mantle.reproduction  --  the TWO ways an AppAI makes another AppAI (Mantle OS)

Doctrine of record: documents/Mantle_Reproduction.md.

There is ONE travelling artifact -- the SPORE, a single PNG carrying the germ (the
complete build data) and build instructions -- and two methods of reproduction. This
module is the single seam that says so; every call delegates to the canonical,
already-audited module. "How does an organism reproduce?" has a two-word answer --
SEED or GRAFT -- and both answers are spores.

  SEED  --  INDEPENDENT reproduction. A spore whose germ declares a WHOLE new AppAI.
            Hatching it is always a BIRTH through the one hatchery door
            (mantle.hatchery.hatch) and faces the same Stage-1 gate every Body faces --
            a tampered seed cannot smuggle an uncertified Body into the world. A bare
            v1 spore (no germ) still hatches: its identity + task distill into a
            minimal germ. Internal tissue of the same act: the VAULT (the organism's
            own sealed germ inside its VCW, for self-reconstruction) and the
            cache-ghost (mantle.ghost, a spore living in an LLM prompt cache).

  GRAFT --  DEPENDENT reproduction: a spore AIMED AT A HOST. The germ inside is a
            non-destructive patch set against a NAMED host, applied in a workspace
            copy; the original is census-proven byte-identical (mantle.graft). The
            same act includes anchoring (mantle.anchor -- dissect the host read-only,
            grow an additive `.mantle/` nest, become the codebase's resident) and is
            sustained by symbiosis (mantle.symbiosis, the metered energy economy).
            Assimilation closes the loop: `mantle assimilate <host> --spore=out.png`
            scans an app and EMITS its spore.

A seed answers to no host, a graft lives in one. Two methods, one artifact, both gated
by the full invariant suite, no standing law weakened.
