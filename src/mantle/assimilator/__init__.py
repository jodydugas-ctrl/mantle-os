"""mantle.assimilator -- Path B: grow organs around existing code, non-destructively.

The prime directive: DO NO HARM. Dissect read-only (scanner), map host tissue to organs
(organ_map), produce the signed Phase-0 artifacts (report), and only then thread host
behavior through the organism with fail-open, reversible wrappers (wrappers). The host
runs exactly as before -- plus now it has a nervous system and a memory.
