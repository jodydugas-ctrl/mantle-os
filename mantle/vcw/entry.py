mantle.vcw.entry  --  the one entry hasher + the one entry maker (Mantle OS · Gen-4)

The rule is simple and total: the hash covers EVERY field of an entry EXCEPT the four
volatile ones the Body is allowed to flip after the fact -- `id` (assigned on append),
`tombstone`, `quarantined` (immune flags), and `hash` itself. So `authorship` and any other
content-bearing extra field are hash-protected by construction: "what your organ does, you
have done" is true in code, not just in prose.
