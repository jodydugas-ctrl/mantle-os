mantle.vcw.metabolism  --  the memory metabolism (Mantle v3)

"Failure is not the end; waste is." Metabolism is how the organism keeps its working set
lean WITHOUT ever losing identity or being forced into a lossy reset:

  compact      drop tombstoned/quarantined entries; an emptied non-tail layer returns to
               the band's free pool for reuse (safe-reuse: only entry-addressed layers)
  dedupe       tombstone entries whose (opcode, content) duplicates an earlier live entry
  reclaim      compact + dedupe in one pass (the standard pressure response)
  pressure     fraction of a band's reserved span currently allocated
  coherence    structural sanity: duplicate ids, active/free overlap

CAPACITY DOCTRINE: crossing OVERFLOW (0.75) or EMERGENCY (0.90) triggers metabolism --
NEVER rebirth. Rebirth stays a separate, chosen reformat (`Organism.rebirth`); reaching
capacity may *motivate* the choice but may never force it.
