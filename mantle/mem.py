mantle.mem  --  the MEM VCW: a keyless knowledge plasmid (Argonaut · M4)

A MEM VCW is a VCW *without an identity key* -- bare memory, like a USB stick. It carries
DATA and MICROCODE-as-data only: no Body, no genesis key, no lineage, no memory tree. It is
the mechanism by which organisms share knowledge (the bacterial plasmid / phagocytosis
model). Because it has no key, a MEM VCW is ALWAYS *other* to any body that finds it.

Two operations:

  excrete(org, knowledge, microcode)
      an organism writes a MEM VCW of distilled knowledge (+ optional microcode carried as
      inert data -- never a live exec layer). The result is a portable cube file.

  digest(org, mem, code_band=None)
      a body that finds an OTHER MEM VCW does NOT use its code directly. It:
        1. reviews the knowledge into `discoveries` as INFERRED (provenance `foreign-MEM`) --
           never into `facts`;
        2. smoke-tests each microcode in the SANDBOX (`trial`): an escape is refused and
           immune-logged, never adopted;
        3. only AFTER its own trial passes may it RE-DERIVE the microcode into SELF -- it
           calcifies the skill under the BODY's own authorship (the organism vouches for it),
           never running the foreign artifact as-is.

Nothing foreign executes outside the sandbox; nothing foreign becomes a fact; nothing
foreign calcifies without the organism's own proof.
