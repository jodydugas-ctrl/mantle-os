mantle.core.events  --  the SignalBus: the organism's reflex/event bus (Mantle v3)

Organs do not reach into each other. They publish SIGNALS onto one deterministic,
synchronous bus and subscribe REFLEXES to the signal kinds they care about. The bus is the
nervous tissue between organs; the cube is the durable record. Properties:

  deterministic   handlers run synchronously, in registration order -- no threads, no
                  reordering, no LLM. A Phase-1 organism's whole behavior is replayable.
  fail-open       a faulting reflex is caught, degraded, and escalated as an IMMUNE event;
                  it never crashes the host and never fails silently (HF-B32).
  bounded         re-entrant emits are queued and drained in order (no recursion blowups);
                  the immune escalation path never re-enters itself.
  inspectable     the bus keeps a small trace ring of the last signals for audit/debug.

Well-known signal kinds (organs may add app-specific ones):
  pulse, sense, significant, reflex, dispatch, immune, pressure, checkpoint, cognition
