mantle.mind.containment  --  the bounded MIND write surface (Mantle OS · Gen-4)

The single choke point for every MIND write. The MIND may write ONLY:

    thoughts   private reflection (veiled)
    brain      brain lifecycle records: dispatch INTENTION/DELEGATED + model traces

Any other band is refused by the Body and recorded as an immune event -- the breach never
executes. The MIND can only ever EXTEND the Body, never break it. Durable truth (`facts`),
the Genome, the immune band, and every other band stay forever out of reach.
