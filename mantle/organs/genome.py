mantle.organs.genome  --  the Genome organ: identity, inheritance & lineage (Mantle v3)

The Genome is held in the BODY, not the cube. There are two distinct genomes: the *agent
genome* (Primer + commandments + defining data -- this organ) lives in the Body; the
*cube genome* (the band layout) is the cube boot sector. The cube is pure experiential
memory; identity survives every rebirth because it never lived in any cube.

Reflexes: boot-order (assemble Primer + Special + Immunization for a model), seal-primer
(reject any post-birth Primer write -- enforced by the Body store itself), inherit (on
rebirth, record the distillation + the sealed ancestor's fingerprint in the lineage index).
