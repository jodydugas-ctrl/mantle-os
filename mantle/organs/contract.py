"""
mantle.organs.contract  --  the organ contract (Mantle v3)

Every organ declares itself with a machine-readable contract: its role, the bands it may
read and write, its reflex surface, its Phase-1 state, its Phase-2 extension, its audit
obligations, and its fail mode. The contract is DATA -- validated when the organism is
wired, enforced when the organ writes (a write outside the declared bands is refused and
becomes an immune event), and inspectable by the audits and by an agent operating the
AppAI runtime.
