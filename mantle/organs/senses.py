mantle.organs.senses  --  the Senses organ: perception, the ONLY inbound boundary (Argonaut, of the Mantle lineage)

ALL inbound data enters the organism through Senses. It ingests external signals,
REDACTS them at the boundary (a secret must never burn into append-only memory), and
CLASSIFIES their significance deterministically -- with NO LLM -- on the compound key
(action_id, event_type):

  REFLEX       bound to an immediate Body response; handled WITHOUT reaching the brain
  ROUTINE      known-mundane; recorded, no escalation
  SIGNIFICANT  anything unrecognized; recorded and (in Phase 2) surfaced to cognition

Every inbound signal produces EXACTLY ONE senses entry. Senses also owns the afferent
half of the surface: the Human Surface Map (the inventory of every human-visible control;
operating them is efferent and belongs to Limbs).
