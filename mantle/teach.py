mantle.teach  --  the EXECUTABLE Field Guide (Mantle OS · Gen-4)

The best instruction manual for growing an AppAI is one that GROWS AN APPAI WHILE YOU
READ IT. Each chapter below narrates one stage of a real organism's life, performs it
live, and PROVES its claim before letting you continue -- the manual is gated exactly
like the organism. FIELD_GUIDE.md is the same manual for reading; this is the one
that runs.

    python -m mantle teach            # all chapters, one organism, hatch to certify
    python -m mantle teach 4          # a single chapter (fresh organism, that stage)
