# examples/vcw — the VCW cube, standalone and fully defined

This directory is the **teaching home of the VCW cube**. Its centerpiece is
[`vcw_cube.py`](vcw_cube.py): a single, pure-stdlib, heavily documented Python file that
is the **normative, runnable definition of the cube format** — how a cube is born, how it
is read and appended, how the veil works, how entries are hashed, how a generation seals,
and how persistence stays atomic. It imports nothing from the `mantle` package, and the
bytes it writes are identical to the production engine's
([`src/mantle/vcw/cube.py`](../../src/mantle/vcw/cube.py)) — [`interop.py`](interop.py) proves
both directions on every CI run.

```bash
# the whole format, proven in one run
python vcw_cube.py selftest

# a cube you can poke at by hand
python vcw_cube.py create demo.vcw
python vcw_cube.py append demo.vcw facts '{"k": "sky", "v": "blue"}'
python vcw_cube.py read demo.vcw facts
python vcw_cube.py tombstone demo.vcw facts 0
python vcw_cube.py verify demo.vcw
python vcw_cube.py inspect demo.vcw
python vcw_cube.py extract demo.vcw 150 layer150.png   # open it in any image viewer
python vcw_cube.py seal demo.vcw

# one format, two faithful implementations (standalone <-> mantle engine)
python interop.py

# timings for the curious
python bench.py
```

## What else is here

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `vcw_cube.py` | **the standalone cube** — read this file to know the format |
| `interop.py` | proof the standalone and the engine speak the same bytes |
| `GUIDE.md` | the substrate teaching guide (concepts → code) |
| `bench.py` | tiny timing harness for the standalone codec |

The full engine lives in [`src/mantle/vcw/`](../../src/mantle/vcw/); this directory keeps the
standalone, normative definition of the cube format and proves it matches the engine
byte-for-byte (`interop.py`).
