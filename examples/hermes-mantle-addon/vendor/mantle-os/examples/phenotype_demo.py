examples/phenotype_demo.py  --  wearable app-faces, end to end (Mantle OS · M9)

Proves the phenotype feature with real surfaces and no model call anywhere:

  1. hatch the calculator egg -> the newborn is BORN wearing its own origin face
     (its front-end source is already sealed in its VCW, SELF-encrypted)
  2. save a SECOND face -- the real examples/Mantle_Spreadsheet_Agent.html surface
  3. wear the spreadsheet face -> its source recovers byte-for-byte (the boot manifest)
  4. an OTHER body (a different genesis key) cannot read either sealed face
  5. a chosen rebirth carries the faces forward -- the default is never lost
