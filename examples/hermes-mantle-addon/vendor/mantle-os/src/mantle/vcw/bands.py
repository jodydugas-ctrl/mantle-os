mantle.vcw.bands  --  boot sectors, the driver registry, the standard genome,
                      and the capacity thresholds (Mantle OS)

Two-level encoding:
  level 1  boot-sector format  = fixed & universal (the Body always understands it)
  level 2  payload format      = programmable (the boot sector names a registered driver)

A band reserves a RANGE of `span` layers starting at `head`; physical layers materialize on
demand and reclaimed layers return to a per-band free pool. Every band declares a purpose.

CAPACITY DOCTRINE (executable): a band's *pressure* is the fraction of its reserved span
that is allocated. Crossing OVERFLOW (0.75) fires an `overflow` immune event and triggers
metabolism (compact/dedupe/reclaim). Crossing EMERGENCY (0.90) fires `emergency` and aggressive
metabolism. Capacity NEVER triggers rebirth: rebirth stays a separate, chosen reformat.
