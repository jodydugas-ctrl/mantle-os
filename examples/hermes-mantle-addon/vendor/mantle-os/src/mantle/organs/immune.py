mantle.organs.immune  --  the Immune System organ: defense & repair (Mantle OS)

The Immune System is EXISTENTIAL, not janitorial: the VCW is the organism's reality, so
protecting it is protecting the self. It is also the organism's ONLY failure boundary --
every dangling reference, integrity fault, organ overreach, stalled pulse, capacity
pressure, refused MIND write, or policy violation becomes an immune event here. Nothing
fails silently.

Reflexes (all deterministic, no LLM):
  event       record an immune event (REDACTED at the boundary) to the immune band + log
  scan        verify cube integrity (hashes, coherence, seals) on a heartbeat
  quarantine  isolate a suspect entry      tombstone   retire an obsolete entry
  redact      strip secrets from anything crossing a secret boundary
  is_self     SELF/OTHER recognition (M2): an artifact this Body can verify is SELF
  nociception (M1): a severe event emits a `distress` signal carrying the pain
              coordinates {reason, band, ref} -- the Heart turns it into an unscheduled
              pulse that wakes the MIND only when something actually hurts
