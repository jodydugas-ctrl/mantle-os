mantle.phenotype  --  wearable app-faces stored inside the VCW (Mantle OS · M9)

One stable organism (Body + append-only cube + nine organs) can express MANY front-facing
surfaces -- a spreadsheet, a CLI, a phone shell, a chat face -- while the nervous system and
the VCW underneath never change. A PHENOTYPE (a "face") is a whole front-end, sealed under the
genesis key into a private VCW band. The Compiler does not run apps; it WEARS them.

Three laws hold it safe -- the same laws as the seed vault (mantle.vault), one band richer:
  * a face is SELF-encrypted (M2): the source is sealed under the genesis key, so it is
    unreadable -- and un-wearable -- as OTHER. A copied nest in a different body gets garbage.
  * a face is SOURCE, never executed here: wearing returns a boot manifest a HOST renders.
    The organism never exec's a front-end's source -- that is exactly what the sandbox forbids.
  * wearing is append-only: the active face is the LATEST wear-event, never an overwrite. Every
    face-save and every change of face is an accreted, immutable, hashed event -- the fossil
    record the doctrine promises ("if it is not in the VCW it did not happen").

THE DEFAULT FACE.  Every hatched organism carries, from its first breath, an encrypted copy of
its ORIGIN surface -- the app it was created from -- as the `default` face. Even if no other
face is ever added, the organism always holds a sealed copy of its own source in the VCW: a
self-reconstruction / security guarantee, the sibling of the seed vault.

THE SOCKET.  A face declares the `controls` it expresses. It is wearable only if every declared
control already has a socket in the organism's Human Surface Map (mantle.organs.senses) -- the
"same nervous system to plug into" the body plan requires. A face that reaches for a control the
body cannot drive is refused.
