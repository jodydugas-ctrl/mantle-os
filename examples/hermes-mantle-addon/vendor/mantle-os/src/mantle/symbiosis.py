mantle.symbiosis  --  the energy economy: the AppAI earns its keep (Mantle OS)

An AppAI lives in SYMBIOSIS with its user. The user provides RESOURCES (API keys) and
ENERGY (API credits); the organism spends energy to think and repays the relationship
with usefulness. Nothing about this is metaphor-only -- it is an auditable ledger in
the organism's own memory:

  the `symbiosis` band (append-only, hashed, like all memory) records:
    GRANT   the user fed the organism (credits granted; a key NAMED, never stored raw)
    SPEND   the organism burned energy (every metered MODEL call is a SPEND first)
    VALUE   the organism recorded work it did for the user (with evidence)

  balance  = sum(GRANT) - sum(SPEND)        -- computed, never stored
  state    = FED (>25% of lifetime grants remain) | HUNGRY (low) | STARVING (0)

THE STARVATION LAW (inherited doctrine, now executable): an organism with no energy
does not die and does not crash -- the MIND sleeps gracefully and the Body keeps
beating. A starved AppAI is a Zombie Body again, not a corpse. Energy can never go
negative; a spend the balance cannot cover is REFUSED + recorded as a `starvation`
immune event.

THE KEY LAW: API keys are resources, not memories. The ledger records a key's NAME and
fingerprint-of-availability only; raw key material is redacted at the boundary like
every other secret (HF-B20). The key itself stays in the keyfile (§0 KEYFILE_PATH).

The symbiotic loop, in code:
    feed -> energy -> metered cognition -> usefulness -> VALUE entries -> the user
    sees an honest account of what their credits bought -> feeds again.
